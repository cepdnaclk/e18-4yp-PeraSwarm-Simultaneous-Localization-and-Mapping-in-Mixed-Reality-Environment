# PeraSwarm: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping in Mixed Reality Environment
___

## Description
The objective of this project is to use swarm robots to efficiently map and navigate complex environments. These autonomous robots work together in a coordinated fashion, leveraging swarm intelligence to create detailed maps, contributing to advancements in autonomous exploration and mapping technology.

## Overview

PeraSwarm is a project that explores the field of swarm robotics, where multiple robots collaborate to achieve tasks in a decentralized and distributed manner. The project focuses on the exploration behavior of swarm robotics in unknown environments, aiming to develop efficient mapping strategies for autonomous mobile robots.

## Key Features

- Integration of physical and virtual robots in a mixed reality environment
- Cost-effective sensor implementation in multi-robot systems
- Decentralized communication approach for enhanced robustness and scalability
- Development of new algorithms for improved efficiency and effectiveness

## Methodology

1. **Physical Robots**: Low-cost robots with differential drive, sensors (distance, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), and modular C++ firmware design.
2. **Virtual Robots**: Java-based virtual robot simulations for scalability and platform independence.
3. **Visualizer**: Techniques for visualizing robot behavior in both virtual and augmented reality environments.
4. **Simulator**: A real-time integration framework for inter-reality communication, localization, and mapping.
5. **Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM)**: Explicit environment modeling approach for robustness and scalability.

## Experiments and Results

- Tested algorithms: Random Movement, Heuristic Approach, Algorithm Based on Nearest Unexplored Cell, and Voronoi Coverage.
- Performance metrics: Time of full coverage, probability of success, and accuracy of exploration using ground truth comparison.
- Results showed the Algorithm Based on Nearest Unexplored Cell outperformed others in terms of faster exploration times and higher success probabilities.

## Future Work

- Explore advanced cooperative localization methods
- Integrate machine learning techniques for improved mapping and localization
- Address challenges in complex sensor usage, decentralized mapping, scalability, and robustness to dynamic environments.
